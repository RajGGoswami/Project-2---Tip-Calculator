# Project-2---Tip-Calculator

This is a beginner-level Python project built as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

The focus of this project is learning how to work with numbers, calculations, and user input, rather than optimizing or refactoring the solution.

**Project Overview**

The Tip Calculator is a simple command-line program that:

Asks for the total bill amount

Asks for a tip percentage

Asks how many people are splitting the bill

Calculates and displays how much each person should pay

This project demonstrates my early understanding of numeric operations and type conversions in Python.

**Why this project exists**

This project helped me practice:

Converting input values to numeric types using float() and int()

Performing calculations with percentages

Storing intermediate results in variables

Using round() to format monetary values

Formatting output using f-strings

The code is intentionally kept simple to reflect where I was in my learning journey at the time.

**How the code works (step-by-step)**

Prints a welcome message.

Prompts the user for the total bill and converts it to a float.

Prompts the user for a tip percentage and converts it to an int.

Prompts the user for the number of people splitting the bill.

Calculates the total bill including tip.

Divides the total by the number of people.

Rounds the result to two decimal places.

Displays the final amount each person should pay.

**Example Output**

Welcome to the tip calculator!

What was the total bill? $150

How much would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12

How many people to split the bill? 5

Each person should pay: $33.6
